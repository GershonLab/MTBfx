#' Item Parameters for the PROMIS Pediatric Strength Impact Item Bank
#'
#' A dataset of IRT calibrations using slope-threshold parameterization for the graded response model. There are 12 items with 5 response categories each. This item bank was chosen because it has several items with extremely large slopes, which have caused problems for item selection algorithms in the past.
